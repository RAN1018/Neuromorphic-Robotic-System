# Neuromorphic-Robotic-System
This project has successfully built FIRST EVER neuromorphic system which combines DVS, SpiNNaker and a Digital Motor, and successfully established communication between them using only a microcontroller. The max speed is ~3k packets/s for both uplink and downlink. The neuromorphic robotic system is implemented to predict the trajectory of a moving ball and then intercept it.
